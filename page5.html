<b>Abstract</b><br>
The ISO 9241-9 standard for computer pointing devices proposes an 
evaluation of performance and comfort [4]. This paper is the first eye tracking 
evaluation conforming to ISO 9241-9. We evaluated three techniques and 
compared them with a standard mouse. The evaluation used throughput (in 
bits/s) as a measurement of user performance in a multi-directional point-select 
task. The "Eye Tracking Long" technique required participants to look at an 
on-screen target and dwell on it for 750 ms for selection. Results revealed a lower 
throughput than for the "Eye Tracking Short" technique with a 500 ms dwell 
time. The "Eye+Spacebar" technique allowed participants to "point" with the 
eye and "select" by pressing the spacebar upon fixation. This eliminated the 
need to wait for selection. It was the best among the three eye tracking 
techniques with a throughput of 3.78 bits/s, which was close to the 4.68 bits/s 
for the mouse.

<h2>1 Introduction</h2>

<h3>ISO 9241 - Part 9</h3>

Beginning with the Apple <I>Macintosh</I> in 1984, graphical user interfaces (GUIs) have 
evolved and matured. The key feature of modern GUIs is the ability for users to 
interact with simple point-and-select operations. The most common pointing device in 
desktop systems is the mouse. To select an on-screen target with a mouse, a user 
manipulates the mouse to maneuver the cursor to a target, then selects the target by 
pressing and releasing a button. Simple as this seems, the interaction is even simpler 
with an eye tracker. The user locates the target by looking at it and follows 
immediately with selection [10].
<p>

Although considerable research exists in eye tracking [3, 6, 9, 10], none has evaluated 
eye tracking with <I>ISO 9241 Ergonomic requirements for office work with visual 
display terminals (VDTs) - Part 9: Requirements for non-keyboard input devices</I>. 
ISO 9241-9 establishes uniform guidelines and testing procedures for evaluating 
computer pointing devices. The metric for comparison is <I>Throughput</I>, in bits per 
second (bits/s), which includes both the speed and accuracy of users' performance. 
The equation for throughput is Fitts' Index of Performance except using an <I>effective</I> 
index of difficulty (<I>ID</I><sub>e</sub>). Specifically,
<p>

<table width=90%>
<tr>
<td width=10%>
<td width=80%>
<i>Throughput</i> = <i>ID</i><sub>e</sub> / <I>MT</I>
<td width=10% align=right>
(1)
</table>
<p>

where <I>MT</I> is the mean movement time, in seconds, for all trials within the same 
condition, and
<p>

<table width=90%>
<tr>
<td width=10%>
<td width=80%>
<I>ID</I><sub>e</sub> = log<sub>2</sub>(<I>D</I> / <I>W</I><sub>e</sub> + 1).
<td width=10% align=right>
(2)
</table>
<p>

<I>ID</I><sub>e</sub>, in bits, is calculated from <I>D</I>, the distance to the target, and 
<I>W</I><sub>e</sub>, the effective width 
of the target. <I>W</I><sub>e</sub> is calculated as
<p>

<table width=90%>
<tr>
<td width=10%>
<td width=80%>
<I>W</I><sub>e</sub> = 4.133 × <I>SD</I>.
<td width=10% align=right>
(3)
</table>
<p>

where <I>SD</I> is the standard deviation in the selection coordinates measured along the 
line from the center of the home square to the center of a target. Using effective width 
allows throughput to incorporate the spatial variability in human performance. It 
includes both speed and accuracy [5].
<p>

<h3>Prior Evaluations</h3>

ISO 9241-9 was in Draft International Standard form in 1998 and became an 
International Standard in 2000. If one considers mouse evaluations in research not 
following the standard, throughput ranged from about 2.6 bits/s to 12.5 bits/s. On the 
contrary, studies conforming to the standard reported throughput from about 3.7 bits/s 
to 4.9 bits/s [8]. The data appear much more uniform and consistent. In short, 
ISO 9241-9 improves the quality and comparability of device evaluations. 
<p>

Although several papers follow ISO 9241-9 and dozens of others use Fitts' law to 
evaluate non-keyboard input devices, Ware and Mikaelian published in 1987 what 
remains the only Fitts' law evaluation of an eye tracking system [10]. They used a 
serial Fitts' law task to test three eye tracking techniques. Task completion time was 
the only performance measure used. They compared eye tracking with the mouse but 
did not calculate or report on throughput as a performance measure. No eye tracking 
evaluation paper has ever been published since then using Fitts' law (or ISO 9241-9). 
<p>

By following the standard and comparing throughput for eye tracking with a baseline 
technique (i.e., a mouse), we can determine how good an eye tracking system is. This 
paper is the first eye tracking evaluation conforming to ISO 9241-9.
<p>

The rest of this paper is organized as follows. In section 2, we described the 
methodology of our experiment. In section 3, the results are presented and discussed. 
Finally, we present our conclusions in section 4.
<p>

<h2>2 Methodology</h2>

An experiment was designed to implement the performance and comfort elements of 
ISO 9241-9. Effort was not tested since we do not have the sophisticated equipment 
necessary for measuring biomechanical load.
<p>

Performance testing was limited to pointing and selecting using multi-directional 
point-and-select tasks following ISO 9241-9 [2]. The testing environment was 
modeled on Annex B in the ISO standard [4]. Comfort was evaluated using the ISO 
"Independent Rating Scale". The design followed, as reasonably as possible, the 
description in Annex C [4].
<p>

<h3>Participants</h3>

Sixteen paid volunteer participants (11 male, 5 female) were recruited from the local 
university campus. Participants ranged from 22 to 33 years (<I>mean</I> = 25). All were 
daily users of computers, reporting 4 to 12 hours usage per day (<I>mean</I> = 7). None had 
prior experience with eye tracking. All participants had normal vision, except one 
who wore contact lenses. Nine participants were right-eye dominant, seven left-eye 
dominant, as determined using the eye dominance test described by Collins and 
Blackwell [1].
<p>

<h3>Apparatus</h3>

A head-fixed eye tracking system, <I>ViewPoint</I>™ from ArringtonResearch, served as 
the input device (Fig. 1). The measurement method was Pupil and Corneal Reflection 
for greater tolerance to head movements. The infrared camera was set to focus on a 
participant's dominant eye. The monitor was a 19-inch 1280 &times; 1024 pixel LCD. 
Participants sat at a viewing distance of approximately 60 cm. The eye tracker 
sampled at 30 Hz with an accuracy of 0.25° &ndash; 1.0° visual arc, or about 10 &ndash; 40 pixels 
with our configuration. Calibration was performed before the first technique involved 
with the eye, with re-calibration as needed. Raw eye data and event data were 
collected and calculated using experimental software developed in our laboratory.

<h3>Procedure</h3>

The main independent variable was Interaction Technique with four levels:

<ul>
<li>ETL	&ndash; Eye Tracking Long
<li>ETS	&ndash; Eye Tracking Short
<li>ESK	&ndash; Eye+Spacebar
<li>M	&ndash; Mouse
</ul>

The ETL technique required participants to look at an on-screen target and dwell on it 
for 750 ms for selection. The dwell time was 500 ms for the ETS technique. The ESK 
technique allowed participants to "point" with the eye and "select" by pressing the 
spacebar upon fixation. To minimize asymmetric learning effects, the four interaction 
techniques were counterbalanced using a 4 × 4 balanced Latin square [7].
<p>

There were three additional independent variables. These were included to ensure that 
the trials covered a reasonable range of difficulties and to collect multiple sample 
points for each condition:
<p>

<ul>
<li>Target Width:	75 pixels, 100 pixels
<li>Distance:	275 pixels, 350 pixels
<li>Trial:		1 to 16
</ul>

Target width was the diameter of the circle target. Distance was the radius of the big 
circle, which was the distance from the center of the home square to the center of the 
circle target. These four conditions and the desired target were randomized. For each 
of the four conditions, the task involved 16 circle targets (Fig. 2). The total number of 
trials was 4096 (16 participants × 4 interaction techniques × 2 distances × 2 widths × 
16 trials).
<p>

At the onset of each trial, a home square appeared on the screen. The home square 
allowed the distance of eye movement for each trial to be approximately the same. 
The home square disappeared after participants dwelled on it, pressed the spacebar, or 
clicked the left mouse button depending on the interaction technique. To exclude 
physical reaction time, positioning time started as soon as the eye or mouse moved 
after the home square disappeared. A window of 2.5 seconds was given to complete a 
trial after the home square disappeared. If no target selection occurred within 
2.5 seconds, a time-out error was recorded. Then, the next trial followed.

To minimize visual reaction time, the desired target was highlighted as soon as the 
participant fixated on the home square (Fig. 2a). The current target showed a blue dot 
when not in focus and a red dot when in focus (Fig. 2b). The dot helped participants 
fixate at the center of the target. The gray background was designed to reduce the eye 
stress caused by a bright color, such as a white background. For all three eye 
techniques, the mouse pointer was hidden to reduce visual distraction.

</blockquote>
<p>

Participants were instructed to point to the target as quickly as possible (look at the 
target or move the mouse depending on the interaction technique), and select the 
target as quickly as possible (dwell on the target, press spacebar, or click the left 
mouse button depending on the interaction technique). After finishing the trials, we 
interviewed each user and gave a questionnaire.
<p>

<h2>3 Results and Discussion</h2>

<h3>Throughput</h3>

As evident in Fig. 3, there was a significant effect of interaction technique on 
throughput (<I>F</I><sub>3,45</sub> = 47.46, <I>p</I> < .0001). The 500 ms dwell time of the ETS technique 
seemed just right. Too short and participants accidentally selected the wrong target; 
too long and participants became impatient while waiting for selection. ETL had a 
lower throughput than ETS due to this. ESK was the best among the three eye 
tracking techniques. We attribute this to participants effectively pressing the spacebar 
immediately upon fixation on the target. This eliminated the need to wait for 
selection. The throughput of the ESK technique was 3.78 bits/s, which was close to 
the 4.68 bits/s for the Mouse. Considering the mouse has the best performance among 
non-keyboard input devices [8], the ESK technique is very promising. As the user 
must press the spacebar (or other key), this observation is qualified by noting that the 
ESK technique is only appropriate where an additional key press is possible and 
practical.

<h3>Point-select Time</h3>

Point-select time is the sum of the positioning time and the selection time. As shown 
in Fig. 4, the point-select time of the ESK technique was significantly lower than for 
the other interaction techniques (<I>F</I><sub>3,45</sub> = 60.82, <I>p</I> < .0001). A post hoc multiple 
comparisons test was performed using the Student-Newman-Keuls method. This 
revealed significance at the <I>p</I> = .05 level for all six comparisons except ETS vs. 
Mouse.

<h3>Error Rates and Time-out Error</h3>

For the ETL and ETS techniques, participants selected the target by dwelling on it. 
Thus, the outcome was either a selection or a time-out error. Therefore, the error rate 
for ETL and ETS were both zero, as shown in Fig. 5. Time-out errors for the ETL, 
ETS and ESK techniques were mainly caused by eye jitter and eye tracker accuracy. 
The longer time needed to perform a selection, the higher chance there would be a 
time-out error. ESK had 2.89% time-out errors, which is much closer to the 1.07% 
time-out errors for the mouse, compared with the other eye tracking techniques.
<p>

<p>


Although ESK yielded the fastest point-select time, as aforementioned, it suffered 
from a high error rate. This is a classic speed-accuracy tradeoff and we attributed it to 
participants pressing the spacebar slightly before fixating on the target, or slightly 
after the eye moved out of the target. Because no participant had prior experience 
with eye tracking, few could do the coordinated work of eye pointing and hand 
pressing of the spacebar very well. The error rate for the ESK technique varied a lot 
across participants (<I>standard deviation</I> = 11.43, <I>max</I> = 35.59, <I>minimum</I> = 3.13). We 
believe participants could have much lower error rates if further training was provided 
and improved feedback mechanisms were considered and tested.
<p>

<h3>Target Width</h3>

As we analyzed all data, an interesting finding surfaced. The width of a target can 
affect the error rate and time-out error. For the ETL, ETS and ESK techniques shown 
in Fig. 6, the time-out error of the large-width target was generally better than for the 
small-width target. For the ETS and ESK techniques, the difference was substantial, 
with about 50% fewer time-out errors for the large-width targets than for the 
small-width targets. We observed a similar pattern as in error rate. We also found that 
although a larger target width can help reduce errors, it had little impact on 
throughput or point-select time.

<h3>Questionnaire</h3>

The device assessment questionnaire consisted of 12 questions. The questions 
pertained to eye tracking in general, as opposed to a particular eye tracking interaction 
technique. Each response was rated on a seven-point scale, with 7 as the most 
favorable response, 4 the mid-point, and 1 the least favorable response. Results are 
shown in Fig. 7.
<p>

<b>Fig. 7</b>. Eye tracker device assessment questionnaire. Response 7 was the most favorable, 
response 1 the least favorable.

<p>

As seen, participants generally liked the fast positioning time of the eye tracker. On 
Operation Speed, the mean score was high at 6.2. However, Eye Fatigue was a 
concern. Participants complained that staring at so many targets made their eyes dry 
and uncomfortable. Eye Fatigue scored lowest among all the questions. Neck Fatigue 
and Shoulder Fatigue were also an issue, since the eye tracking system we tested was 
head-fixed. Participants gave eye tracking a favorable response overall of 4.5, just 
slightly higher than the mid-point (see top two entries in Fig. 7). Discussions 
following the experiment revealed that participants liked to use eye tracking and 
believed it could perform similar to the mouse. Of the three eye tracking techniques, 
participants expressed a preference for the Eye+Spacebar technique. Concerns were 
voiced, however, on the likely expense of eye tracking system, the troublesome 
calibration procedure, and uncomfortable need to maintain a fixed head position.
<p>

<h2>4 Conclusion</h2>

This paper is the first eye tracking evaluation conforming to ISO 9241-9. Four 
point-select interaction techniques were evaluated, three involving eye tracking and one 
using a standard mouse. The Eye Tracking Long technique yielded a lower 
throughput than the Eye Tracking Short technique. The Eye+Spacebar technique was 
the best among the three eye tracking interaction techniques. It had a throughput of 
3.78 bits/s, which was close to the 4.68 bits/s for the Mouse. Participants generally 
liked the Eye+Spacebar technique.
<p>

More work is planned to determine the best settings for eye tracking, for example, the 
optimal target size and color highlighting. In the future, we intend to evaluate eye 
tracking in a longitudinal study and in text entry applications.
